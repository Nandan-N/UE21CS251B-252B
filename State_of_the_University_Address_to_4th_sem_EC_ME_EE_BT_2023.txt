By the Pro-Chancellor,
- they have been trying to hold this in the first wk of every sem for 5 yrs, this time its been successful
- with a hand poll, most ppl did better in 3rd sgpa than 2nd sgpa and credits the multiple isa system of it and hoping that there will be no complaints of it
- hand poll of student sgpa brackets. most got 6.5 (aka not abv 7). highly disappointed
- 50% engineers now. placements in 3 sems. 
- batch of 2022 had 407 placements abv 12LPA, batch of '23 had 485 [includes both campuses]
- most who got 12LPA got 8.75 GPA
- mentorship in smaller branches [such as BT EE ME] should be better in quality compared to larger branches like CS
- they will make sure to have 100% placements in BT EE ME by matching requirements to market place and this will not be hard
- all of this inspite of majority BT and ME going abroad due to "supposedly thinking there is no adequate core jobs in india and do not match interests"
- however, for EE and EC this should not be a problem as you have same opportunities as CS
- computing requirement is regardless of branch. do CS MINOR to everyone UNLESS you promise to nvr apply to a CS job in your life. this is not marketing and is only advise on the opportunity to do the right thing
- story: california based playstation employee who did EC works on CS heavy work
- hand poll on those who take cs minors: sparsely spread hands raise, with him saying good choice to them
- minors are not lower standard
- story: parent came asking daughter [cs, 7.1 gpa] why no placement offer for her. after digging, they found she didnt attend any placement test
- hundreds of placements tests done before and during placements for FREE. but 800 becomes 600 to 500 to 400 and 80 [implying exponential less ppl caring abt it]
- in order to try and push this strongly, if U DO NOT PARTICIPATE in these tests, NO PLACEMENTS.
- 6.75 minimum for placement (along with some 10th and 12th stuff). they collect data on placements
- goal setting: fun days at uni over, now its time for work
- for higher studies, talk to mentor abt gre scores, research paper lvls, GPA
- by end of 4th sem, you should know ur domain. no long time. this will happen along with isa in [mentions week numbers of all isa tests]
- only 4 hrs of study per day enough to be in good shape, no other shortcut
- understands that everyone has different abilities
- if you want JOB OF 12LPA+, TAKE CS MINOR; be presentable
- this model was to be told to faculty after management pushed it on them
- along with the isa and esa, there will be 3 LEVELS OF HIGHER-ORDER PROJECTS FOR EACH COURSE
> Lvl 1: individual, happens after unit 3 is done. 2 weeks time, after which a workshop will be conducted by faculty or industrial expert/consultant on the problem statement. known as the "banana" for its simplicity, 80% industry can work on this
> 
> lvl2: group, right after the workshop of lvl 1. 2 weeks time, similar workshop. known as "orange", 15% of industry can work on this, improves integration
> 
> lvl 3: individual, hackathon during the week after ISA 5, in-campus. known as "jackfruit", will tell which domain we are suited for

> teachers will provide all resources (other than the already conducting classes)
> attending the workshops will ensure 5/5 marks irrespective of whether you learnt anything or not
> this should ensure less ppl will copy
> winners/ppl who did good will be compensated properly
